# Compact Projectiles
This package is a physics simulation of a Box that does not use Rigidbody. It is suitable for use as an effect.

At the start and upon each collision, one to three SphereCasts are executed to simulate the parabolic trajectory until the next collision. While in the air, it only reproduces the simulation results without performing calculations.

# Hou to Use
- The easiest way is to use the ProjectileController component.  
- You can control the simulation by using the BoxProjectile class from a custom class.
